# Recipe-Organizer-MySQLdatabase

# About
Our project is designed for a growing online platform that connects home cooks, food enthusiasts, and restaurants seeking to share and discover new recipes. The “client” in this case is a local, family-owned restaurant group that wants to expand its presence by enabling people to browse and review recipes, add items to a shopping list, and access restaurant menu offerings in a centralized interface. This restaurant group prides itself on using locally sourced ingredients and aims to create a vibrant, community-oriented environment both online and in-person. By building a comprehensive database, we help the client maintain consistent, accurate data about recipes, ingredients, and user feedback while streamlining the process of adding or updating menu items and pricing.
